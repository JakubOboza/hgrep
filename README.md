# `grep -r .`
this is implementation of `grep -r .` function in haskell.

# why ?
This is just to play a bit with haskell IO and find out if haskell native code can be faster then `grep -r` or  `zargs **`.
It is not optimal yet.

# building

to build this just run `./build.sh` and you will have hgrep in `bin` folder
